# Openshot Markers
The video editor [OpenShot][2] is great, but it lacks a for me very important 
feature: export video clips based on markers. OpenShot stores markers as frame 
numbers, but for export you can't choose frame numbers, only time in minutes 
and seconds. *Openshot Markers* converts those frame numbers to timestamps, so 
the user can then input them into OpenShot.
